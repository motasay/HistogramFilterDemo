This simple demo has been built during Udacity's CS373 "Programming A Robotic Car" class. It illustrates histogram filters by displaying the probability distribution for the location of the robot while it's moving/sensing in a 2D multi-colored grid.

### Screenshots:

* Uniform distribution:

* After moving the robot and sensing many times:

The white/red circles represent the probabilities of the robot being on each circle's cell. As the probability increases, so does the diameter of the circle. The red circle represents the biggest probability.
